# ----Welcome to my Ops 201 Challenges README----

# About:
This repository hosts all of my scripting files that I create with bash, powershell, and python during my ops challenge assignments.

# Why am I learning these skills?
I am learning these skills because I believe they are a viable asset to a cybersecurity professional.  Knowing how to write basic scripts in a few different languages will
open up oppurtunities for automating security tasks and creating basic applications.

# What fundamental concepts did I learn in Ops 201?
I definitely learned a lot in this class.  I learned how to troubleshoot ubuntu and windows systems at the administrative level, remove malware, install software, and create
automation scripts using bash and powershell.

# What was my favorite Ops Challenge assignment?
My favorite ops challenge assignment would definitely be Challenge 13.  I enjoyed writing this challenge in bash because I created a mini tool that asks for an input, performs 
5 tasks at once and displays the output to your screen.  The tool I created is very useful for looking up a domain and fetching every public piece of information from that domain.

# How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
These examples of shell scripting can be applied to the workplace in every aspect.  You can create scripts that make your life and your job easier, faster, and more efficient.
You don't want to be messing around typing in 200 commands for 20 different IP's when you can create a script with those commands and then just run the IP's.

# What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
I would continue to improve my most recent script (Challenge 13) and create a mini CLI-only based application from it.

# What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
I hope to improve legibility and efficiency.
